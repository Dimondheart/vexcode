##What Is This?##

Contains sample programs for VEX Cortex code used through RobotC.


###What Types of Sample Code can be found here?###

As of the moment this readme was created, not much!  I plan to include samples ranging from the following areas:

- Driving (Vexnet Joystick Controller)
- Sensors (LEDs, Sonar, Touch, Light, etc.)
- More complex/complicated C concepts (State Functions, Advanced Code, etc.)
